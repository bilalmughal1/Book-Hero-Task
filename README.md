Book Hero Candidate Task

Task Description
The task was to create a responsive web page with a registration form that includes the following fields: Name, Email, Password, and a checkbox for agreeing to terms and conditions. The web page needed to have a header with a logo and a navigation menu, a banner section with an image and a call-to-action button, and a section that contains the registration form. The form needed to have validation for the email and password fields, and an error message should be displayed if the user enters incorrect data. The form should not be submitted if the user has not agreed to the terms and conditions. The web page should be styled using CSS Grid and/or Flexbox and should have a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes. The form should be submitted using JavaScript and the data should be logged to the console.

Code Functionality
The HTML code consists of the basic structure of the web page, with separate sections for the header, banner, and form. The CSS code uses both CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive layout and style the page. The JavaScript code adds functionality to the registration form by validating the email and password fields and preventing the form from being submitted if the user has not agreed to the terms and conditions. When the form is submitted, the data is logged to the console.

The web page is designed to be responsive and adjust to different screen sizes. You can try resizing the browser window to see the layout change.
The code for this task uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive web page with a registration form. The code is well-organized and easy to understand, with comments explaining the purpose of each section.
In summary, this task demonstrates the ability to create a functional and responsive web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form validation ensures that user input is accurate and complete, and the data logging feature provides useful information for further analysis.
